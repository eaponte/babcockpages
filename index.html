                    Babcock Pages came about because of the need for new and current residents to find out about the goods, services, and restaurants offered by the community and surrounding areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As residents of Babcock Ranch, we have come to rely on the helpfulness of neighbors through various, non-official Facebook groups created by like-minded residents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As such, I have decided to try and organize all the helpful suggestions made by fellow neighbors and present it all in one place.
