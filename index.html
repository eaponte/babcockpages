                    Babcock Pages came about because of the need for new and current residents to find out about the goods, services, and restaurants offered by the community and surrounding areas.

                <p>
                    As such, I have decided to try and organize all the helpful suggestions made by fellow neighbors on non-official neighborhood Facebook groups and present it all in one place.
