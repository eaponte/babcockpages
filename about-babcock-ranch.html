                        Babcock Ranch, adjacent to the 73,000 acre Babcock Ranch Preserve, is a master-planned community under development on the Lee and Charlotte County line in Southwest Florida. The planned community was approved as part of a public-private partnership with the State of Florida and local governments. With 18,000 acres of land, Babcock Ranch will grow to accommodate 19,000 homes and 50,000 residents when completed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="width-90">
						The community is considered to be the first fully solar powered city in the nation. A large solar farm several miles north of the town and a network of rooftop solar panels on commercial buildings are intended to send more renewable power into the Florida electrical grid than the city consumes.
                    </p>
					<p class="width-90">
						The center of town, also known as Founders Square, has been configured to host festivals and events, and features places to eat, bicycle and watersports rentals, and a superb view of Lake Babcock. Bands frequently play at Founders Square, and weekend nights are filled with a variety of food trucks frequented by local residents and nearby communities.
					</p>
					<p class="width-90">
						Local businesses in Founders Square include the Lee Health Healthy Life Center, The Lakehouse Kitchen & Bar Restaurant, Slater's Goods & Provisions, The Hatchery (a coworking and office space located above Slater's), and Bloom Academy pre-kindergarten school.
